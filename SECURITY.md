# Security Note

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take Security seriously and personally. I highly appreciate your findings and disclosure.

To report a security issue, email [denosaurabh@gmail.com](mailto:denosaurabh@gmail.com) and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

I will soon send a response with steps with eliminate the vulnerability.

Report security bugs in third-party dependencies to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the [Node Security Project](https://nodesecurity.io/report).
